```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
```

The first step is to download the data. We import csv calender data from inside-AirBNB. 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
urls = c('http://data.insideairbnb.com/united-states/nc/asheville/2022-06-11/data/calendar.csv.gz','http://data.insideairbnb.com/united-states/tx/austin/2022-06-08/data/calendar.csv.gz')

"for (url in urls) {
  filename = paste(gsub('[^a-zA-Z]', '', url), '.csv') # keep only letter, removing the //:, etc.
  filename = gsub('httpdatainsideairbnbcom', '', filename) # wipe httpdatainsideairbnbcom from filename
  download.file(url, destfile = filename) # download file"
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

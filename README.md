## Introduction
Welcome to the 'could shortterm Airbnb weekdays stay become as expensive as weekends?' repository. 
This README provides detailed instructions on how to use the contents in this repository for future use.

## Motivation
Shortterm weekday stays are becoming increasingly popular in the U.S (Chipkin, 2022). Demand for Tuesday night stays grew 5% from 2019 to 2021; Wednesdays came in a close second, followed by Mondays and Thursdays. In the past Airbnb hosts were quickly inclined to lower their prices for renting the Airbnb during the week, while instead, they maybe could increase prices. Currently, Airdna (2022) claims that it is an ideal time to optimize the pricing strategy for the Airbnb hosts. 

From the top 25 most popular Airbnb cities (Airdna, 2019), the 5 biggest cities are chosen: Portland, San Francisco, Denver, Los Angeles, New York. By gathering and analyzing data of 5 cities spread over the U.S., we could see if the hosts in the U.S. already adapted their pricing strategy. There is a possibility that the roomtype (entire place, private room, hotel room or a shared room) has an impact. 

The general question for this study project is as follows: 

**“*To what extent does the day of the week (weekend vs. weekday) impact pricing of Airbnb in the U.S.? And does this significantly differ per roomtype, and does this significantly differ between the 5 U.S. cities?*”**

There are no sources available for the top 5 Airbnb in Europe, which agree or disagree with the statement from the U.S. For this reason, we thought it would be interesting to find out if this trend (also) exists in Europe. The 5 most popular Airbnb countries in Europe will be analyzed: Munich, Milan, Paris, London and Dublin (**BRON**). In the end, the U.S. and Europe will be compared. 

## Method
**Variables:**
```bash
- Price
- Date 
- Location 
- Computed variable weekend or weekday
